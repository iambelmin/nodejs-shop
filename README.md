# SIMPLE SHOP MADE USING NODE.JS

I want to share simple Node.js shop project made in 2018. It is the first BIG project for me that I have done while still learning Node.js. I have done the whole process from research to deployment. 

## Overview
---
This Node.js shop is built with help of Express, Passport, Handlebars, MongoDB(mongoose), Bootstrap and Stripe. Throughout this project I have implemented login system, mailing/contact form, cart, managing orders, Stripe Payments and it also has abilities to add, delete, modify following: 

* Products
* Users
* Prodcut Categories
* Product Colors
* Product Sizes
* Testimonials 

Webshop is multilanguage it currently is using Germany, English and Bosnian languages. 

**Please note:**
This project is old and and some modules are deprecated, also there are some updates that are done after this has been finished so for example Stripe payments are integrated but not fully. 

## How to run?
---
1. Make sure MongoDB is configured and running / HTTP is configured based on your needs
2. Seed data to collections (run `node ./seed/*.js` from . dir)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Start the server - `npm run start`
